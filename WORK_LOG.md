I spent most of my time trying to figure out how to complete the buildTable function. Lily was really helpful for this step. |

| November 2 |  12-1pm   | I spent time brainstorming how to use arrays and lists to return the value for a given key from the csv file. Directly storing everything in an array like a map with an index for the key pointing to the value takes up far too much space. Because of the large size of the datasets, lookups should probably be O(1). One idea I had was maybe implementing some sort of hash situation like for DNA, and for this case, hash the key. I pulled the code from DNA for hashing using horner's method. |

Somehow have like buckets of values and add new values to end of list. Mr. Blick talked about the differences between array, lists, and arraylists which was interesting, so I think based off this discussion, I will tentatively use an ArrayList despite the resizing issue. |

I want to use a class for key value pairs and then for my hashmap class, I want a method to hash, resize, insert, and find. |



To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
