| October 30 | 1130-12pm | I was pretty confused by how to complete the buildTable function and what a buffered reader object is. I spent most of my time trying to figure out how to complete the buildTable function. Lily was really helpful for this step. |
| November 2 | 11-1115pm |                                                                                                  I was still confused by a buffered reader object, so I spent some more time reading about buffered reader objects on geekforgeeks. |
